    <h3>Food Insecurity in New York State</h3>
  </div>

    <h1>Food insecurity in New York varies in rural, urban areas
  </h1>
    <h4>By <em>Rosina Boehm</em></h4>

      <p>Many people live in food insecure areas in New York state, and access varies both in rural and urban places. Some New York counties are not food insecure while others have around 50% of their population with low food access. 
       </p>
      <p>The Food Atlas Research Access (FARA) qualifies a food insecure area as low access and 20% low income. Low access varies in urban and rural areas. In urban areas, the population lives one mile or more away from a <a href="https://gisportal.ers.usda.gov/portal/apps/experiencebuilder/experience/?id=a53ebd7396cd4ac3a3ed09137676fd40&page=Measuring-Access" target="_blank">grocery store</a> in rural areas, the population lives 10 miles or more from a grocery store, according to FARA.</p>

      <p>“Rural food insecurity poses its own issues because it's us getting the food to a central location, but then a lot of times the issues arise with that central location trying to get the food out to individuals because of transportation issues,” said Lynn Hy Chief Development Officer at Food Bank of Central New York.“In the city, you can take a bus or you might be able to walk to your local pantry. If you're living out in the country, you most likely can't do that.”

  <p>Several counties don’t have a share of the population with low food access, including all five of New York City’s boroughs. However, rural areas make up a lot of New York’s food insecurity, including Lewis County at 51.523%, which is “very rural,” Hy said.</p>

  <p>Lewis is one of 11 counties Hy’s organization oversees. Lowville, a town in Lewis, has an expansive food pantry at a specific location that works as a central hub for people in the county, Hy said. 
  </p>

  <p>The CNY area in general has a variety of needs, both in rural and urban areas and for youth and seniors. Many students, particularly those in Onondaga County qualify for a weekly bag of food. Around 1000 students in the Syracuse City School District do, Hy said.
  </p>

  <p>“It's not snacks, it's actual food items, so it might be peanut butter and jelly and cereal, or it might be a pouch of chicken with some canned vegetables,” Hy said. 
</p>

<p>However, the need is great throughout the entire region Hy oversees. Every county covered by the Food Bank of CNY has more students with are food insecure than the state average of 14.8%, according to FARA data.

“For kids that affect their learning, their physical health care development–even their behavior in school, their school attendance–all of these things have been linked to food insecurity,” Krista Hesdorfer, Director of Public Affairs at Hunger Solutions New York, said. 
</p>

<p>In addition to weekly food bags, people in central New York also can get Food $en$e boxes that have everything they need for only $20.50. They also have set up food pantries in hospitals so people under care who need it can easily access food. 
</p>

<p>While local programs can be very helpful, food pantries and food banks only provide one meal for every nine meals the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program provides, Hesdorfer said. Hunger Solutions NY focuses on federal programs because these programs are more effective.

</p>

<p>These programs are at risk with several bills being assessed that may cut funding to SNAP for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. The organization is concerned about potential cuts in funding because they can barely provide SNAP benefits at the rate they want to now, Hesdorfer said. 
</p>

<p>“Whatever happens in those federal negotiations will have a huge impact here in New York,” Hesdorfer said. “We're hoping to see some positive improvements, and we'd like to see benefit amounts increase to be more adequate for folks.” 
</p>

<p>Hesdorfer said Hunger Solutions NY is pushing congress to gain more funding because people are risk of losing their benefits with current discussions. Many partner programs may not be able to operate at full scale, including the Food Bank of CNY, Heserdorfer said.  
</p>

<p>Hy described food as medicine and that people need a good diet in order to live, which can be difficult across the state with the different needs in rural and urban areas. Additionally, food insecurity in New York and the country are rising, which means that the work Hy and Hesdorfer does is becoming more important, Hy said.  
</p>

<p>“In that first year, the entire year we took in and distributed 330,000 pounds of food,” Hy said. “What's interesting about that is we do way more than that every week now.”
